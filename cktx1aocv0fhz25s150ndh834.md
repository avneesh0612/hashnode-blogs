So here are some points on how ***not *** to become a better developer

### Learn multiple programming languages at once
Good programmers focus only on one language and try to learn it properly. Learning one language at once helps you focus on it properly and know what exactly is going on.

### Shoot first, think later
Why think about the problem, solve it, and then type the code, when you can type gibberish again and again and pray it works the nth time?

### Watching tutorials than doing Projects
Do you know how fun it is to just watch countless tutorials on a sofa, without taking notes? 

### Stay in your cocoon 
Socializing, building networks, joining communities? NAH. Better stay in my cocoon and game all day. Just never touch social media platforms like discord, Instagram, Twitter for good use.

### Donâ€™t Accept Feedback
Only good programmers ask others from various communities, to give feedback on what they made. This is precisely what you should avoid!

### Think you know everything
Always think you know everything and never Google a problem or try to research about it. You know it, spend 10 days on a bug instead of getting the answer in 10 minutes.

### Don't contribute to open source
Why contribute to the open-source projects and have a look at how their code? Just look at your code and follow your code practice!

### Don't document your journey
A great thing that good devs do is documenting their journey.

> Teaching is a great way to keep learning.

But this is what are we are trying not to do!
