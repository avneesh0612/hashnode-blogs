## How to contribute to an open-source project and make a PR?


We are going to use GitHub to make the PR and a few git commands. If you donâ€™t know about Git and GitHub check out my crash course.

Today, we are going to contribute to an open-source project. So I am gonna contribute to an [open-source audible clone](https://github.com/avneesh0612/audible) that I created.

Go to the repository you want to contribute and click on the fork button in the top left corner of the screen.

Clone the repo you have been redirected to

```
git clone url_redirected_to
```


### Installing dependencies

If you use yarn then run

```
yarn install # yarn

npm install # npm
```


### Starting server

If you are using yarn then run

```
yarn dev # yarn

npm run dev # npm
```


### Additional setup

If an open-source project is using a tech that requires credentials like firebase, next auth, or an API then we would need to configure that if we want to build a feature related to it.

### Making a PR

**Pushing the code to Github**

```
git add .
git commit -m "commit message (what you added)"
git push origin new-feature
```


After pushing the code go to your repository go to your repository and now this button will be enabled.
