## Edit any Github repository on the web without installing anything😱

Hey there 🙋🏻‍♂️👋🏻,

Github released a new feature recently. If you go to any GitHub repository and click on the `.` on your keyboard, you will be able to see a web version of Visual Studio Code with the files of that repository. Now you can even edit the repository without installing anything!

You can also install extensions and themes in the web version but make sure that you are signed in to your GitHub account.
