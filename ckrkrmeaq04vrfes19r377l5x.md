### What is Auth0?

Auth0 is an easy-to-implement, adaptable authentication and authorization platform. If you want to follow along with this tutorial, you can create a free Auth0 account [here](https://auth0.com/signup?utm_source=external-post&utm_medium=link_placement&utm_campaign=devmar-media).

### Setup

I am going to set up a new next app with create-next-app.

```
npx create-next-app next-auth0-demo
```


### Cleanup

I will delete everything after the Head starting from the main till the footer.


Install [Next-Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)

```
npm i next-auth # npm
yarn add next-auth # yarn
```


### Start using Next auth

We will first create a folder inside the `api` folder in pages called `auth`.

In that folder create a file called ***[â€¦nextauth].js***

We are going to use auth0 as the provider, so we need three params. So add this snippet of code in your ***[â€¦nextauth].js***.


Now we will finally configure Next Auth in ***_app.js*** like this -


### Setting up an application in Auth0

**Creating an app**

* Sign up to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup?utm_source=external-post&utm_medium=link_placement&utm_campaign=devmar-media)

* Go to applications under the applications tab

* Create a new application

* Select Regular Web Applications and give a name to your app, then click on create.

**Getting the credentials**

In the settings tab copy the domain,`client id` , and the `client secret`and add it to your .env.local file.


We will also add the NEXTAUTH_URL in the env like this

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```


### Creating a sign-in button


Now if we try to sign in, we will see this error page

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1627312106571/07_AgYu6b.png)

We need to add [http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0](http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0) as an allowed callback URL and save it.

Now we can sign in successfully!


### Getting user info

We will create a function with `getServerSideProps`where we will get our user details via session.


We would like to have a signout button if the user is already signed in. So we will have a sign-in button if there is no user and a signout button if there is a user.

So create a ternary operator like this


And then import everything we need from next-auth/client.


### Showing the user details

We are going to add this code to get the userâ€™s email, name, and image.


The final code should be like this


As we are using the Next image, we will need to add the domain in ***next.config.js***

We are using google sign in, so we will add lh3.googleusercontent.com as the domain, if you donâ€™t know the origin of the image you can use the normal img tag instead.


### Deployment

I will create a new GitHub repository and push the code there. If you donâ€™t about git and GitHub. Check my [Git and Github Crash Course](https://avneeshagarwal.medium.com/git-and-github-crash-course-b44f4885ff66).

After that go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

* Sign up with your GitHub

* Click on create a new project

* Import the repository that you created

* Click deploy

Your site will now be deployed but the authentication wonâ€™t work.

Adding environment variables.

* After the site is deployed go to the dashboard of the current app click on settings and then Environment Variables.

* Add the Auth0 client id, Auth0 client secret, and Auth0 domain which is present in our .env.local file.

* After you add the two it will look like this.

* We will add another variable, our Next Auth URL and it will be the deployed URL instead of the localhost.

* To get the URL, click on domains, get the shortest link, and add it to the NEXTAUTH_URL variable. It would be similar to [https://next-auth0-demo.vercel.app/](https://next-auth0-demo.vercel.app/)

* Finally, go to the Deployments tab on the tab in the header.

* Click on the latest version and press redeploy.

### Change the URI in Auth0

Finally, replace localhost:3000 with the actual URL and use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

Our authentication is now working perfectly. Congratulations. You have created your first Auth0 sign-in with Next Auth! ðŸ¥³

If you have found this useful, be sure to let me know in the comments. You can also let me know if you want to see any other kind of authentication.
