One of the biggest question marks while contributing to open source is what to contribute to?

So let's see where to find these repositories-

###  [GitHub search/explore](https://github.com/explore) 

Github is a great way to find other open-source projects to work on. Here you can search by-
* Topics
* Languages
* Stars
* Trending
* And many more

A great topic to search for is [`good first issue`](https://github.com/search?q=good+first+issue&type=issues). You can find beginner friendly issues that are easier to contribute
