## My journey of becoming a technical writer

## A little about me
I am 13 year old web developer, content creator, technical writer, and student. I love to make beautiful and interactive websites with Next.js. I also like to document my journey and teach others by writing articles about what I am learning.

## How I started Programming?
 Last year (2020) I saw a video on youtube with the title "Let's Build a GOOGLE Clone with REACT JS for Beginners!". I was fascinated to see that you can build such awesome things by learning to program. So I started learning to learn about web development.

## How I became a technical writer?
A friend of mine who was into technical writing suggested me to start writing. With the help of his guidance, I wrote my first article on Medium. Ever since I have been writing articles on different platforms but at the end loving Hashnode the most.


## What motivates me to be consistent?
I love to teach people and the amazing responses and comments that I get make me happy and helps me to keep going. After I joined Hashnode I have been more consistent because of some amazing challenges like  [2Articles1week](https://hashnode.com/challenge/2articles1week). Because of this challenge I wrote 2-3 articles every week for 4 weeks!


## My goals as a writer
My main reason for writing is getting to teach many people and document my journey.

But like everyone I also have some goals-

* Start doing freelance writing
* Get 100k total blog views

These are the only two goals for my technical writing right now, I am working hard on achieving and I hope I reach there soon ü§ûüèª


## A few words about the Hashnode Bootcamp
Day 1 of the Bootcamp held by Hashnode was amazing and helped me get a lot of ideas on how to improve my writing skills.
