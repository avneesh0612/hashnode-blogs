## My experience of Hacktoberfest 2021

I have been participating in a great and the biggest event for open source this month- Hacktoberfest! In this article, I am going to tell you how I participated and how I enjoyed this event.

> Hacktoberfest is about contributing to open source, not getting free swag.

I participated as a maintainer and a contributor this year at Hacktoberfest

## What I did as a contributor
I have made a total of 16 Contributions this month so far and 15 of them got accepted! I am going to show you some of my PRs and what I did in those PRs-


###  [Hacktoberfest-projects](https://github.com/max-programming/hacktoberfest-projects) 

In Hacktoberfest Projects I added some animations to make it look better and enhance the experience and interactivity of the user. This feature was also requested by the maintainer so I made a  [PR ](https://github.com/max-programming/hacktoberfest-projects/pull/20) for the same :D.

###  [4C Site](https://github.com/FrancescoXX/4c-site) 
The 4C site was having many outdated packages and a few warnings that had to be fixed, so I decided to fix them up. It was pretty simple to fix. You can check out the Pull request  [here](https://github.com/FrancescoXX/4c-site/pull/78).
