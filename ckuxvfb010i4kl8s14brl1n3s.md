## Create nice Readmes for your open source projects ‚ú®

Creating good Readmes for your open source project is very important to get some popularity, stars, forks, and contributors. So today we are going to look at 2 ways to create beautiful Readmes.

###  [1. Readme-md-generator](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator) 

This CLI tool generates a great looking in a few minutes. To use this tool run-

```
npx readme-md-generator
```
After running this command, it will ask you a bunch of questions for adding in the readme.

After you have answered all the questions it will create a README.md file for you that looks like this-
