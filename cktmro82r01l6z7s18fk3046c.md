## What is Open Source and how to get started?

### What is Open Source?

Open source is a commonly used term for the code which is publically accessible and people can see, edit, and share the data. In open source projects, developers from all around the world can contribute to the project and make it better.

### Benefits of Open Source

- Scalable
- Secure as code is public
- Flexible
- Fast

### Cons of Open Source
- Needs maintenance
- Hidden costs
- Support
- User friendly

### Getting Started
#### Getting started with open source as a maintainer
To get started with open source as a maintainer, you need to do the following steps

- Build a project
- Add it as a public repo to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
- Add some docs on what it is and how to contribute
- Add a license to your repo
- Add some issues in the issues section (if you have any)
- Let everyone know about it (if no one knows about it then no one will be able to contribute :P)


#### Getting started as a contributor
- Find a repo you want to contribute to
- Add the features or bug fixes
- Make a pull request
- Wait for your code to be merged
